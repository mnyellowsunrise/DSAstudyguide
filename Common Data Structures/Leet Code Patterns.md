    Sliding Window: This pattern involves iterating over a sequence of elements in a series of contiguous subarrays (windows) to solve problems efficiently. It's commonly used for problems involving strings, arrays, or linked lists.

    Two Pointers: In this pattern, you use two pointers to iterate through a data structure, typically an array or a linked list, to solve problems that require linear time complexity. It's often used for problems involving searching, sorting, or finding pairs.

    Fast and Slow Pointers: This pattern involves using two pointers moving at different speeds to solve problems like cycle detection in linked lists or finding the middle of a linked list.

    Merge Intervals: This pattern involves merging overlapping intervals or ranges in an array to solve problems like interval scheduling or meeting room allocation.

    Top K Elements: This pattern involves finding the top K elements in a data structure, typically an array or a heap, to solve problems like finding the Kth largest element or the most frequent elements.

    Depth-First Search (DFS): DFS is a traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's commonly used for problems involving graph traversal, backtracking, or recursion.

    Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It's commonly used for problems involving shortest paths, level-order traversal, or connected components.

    Binary Search: This pattern involves searching for a target value in a sorted array or range of elements by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It's commonly used for problems involving searching, sorting, or divide and conquer.

    Dynamic Programming (DP): DP is a technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of those subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It's commonly used for problems involving optimization, sequence alignment, or shortest paths.

    Backtracking: This pattern involves systematically exploring all possible solutions to a problem by making choices and backtracking when a solution is found to be invalid. It's commonly used for problems involving permutations, combinations, or subset generation.

    The Greedy Algorithm pattern involves making decisions at each step based solely on the current state, without considering the overall impact on the future. It aims to find the best possible solution by selecting the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that it leads to the globally optimal solution. This approach is often used when finding an optimal solution requires a series of choices, and making the best choice at each step leads to an acceptable overall solution.

    Common indicators for identifying the Greedy Algorithm pattern include problems where the goal is to maximize or minimize a certain value while satisfying specific constraints. These problems often involve scheduling tasks, finding the shortest path in a graph, or partitioning intervals in an optimal way. In Greedy Algorithm problems, each decision is made based solely on the current state, without considering future consequences, which distinguishes it from other patterns like Dynamic Programming, where decisions are made based on future subproblems.
